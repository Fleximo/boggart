1. Here are some changes from me  (Fleximo).....
Now its your turn, Dimkabz :)

Hi, it's me again. If you don't want to eneter your password each time on 
"push" command, just open your command line in local repo and type:
git config remote.origin.url https://you:password@github.com/you/example.git
(replace "you" on your github name, "password" - on your password on github).
Enjoy! :)... It's time to have some sex and sleep ;)
